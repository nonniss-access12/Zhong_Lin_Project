# Zhong_Lin_Project
The objective of this milestone is to build a comprehensive latency model for robot execution, beginning with a robot car and potentially extending to various other types of robots in the future. This model will be used for analyzing the execution time of each action performed by the robot.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Procedure:
1.) Add a timer in the code, to measure the time duration of moving forward/back/left/right
2.) Obtain a dataset that contains the moving distance and time duration
3.) Given this dataset. you can build a time model, the input of the model is the action name A and distance X, the output is the time duration for taking this action A with distance X
4.) Test the model under different settings
